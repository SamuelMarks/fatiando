GOALS FOR 1.0:

* Make Developement Guide


GOALS FOR 0.1:

* Migrate C extensions from f2py to Cython
* Incorporate Tesseroids: gravitational modeling in spherical coordinates
* Make pure Python alternatives to C modules. Use C modules if available at run
  time. Example: prism.py overloads its functions with those of _cprism.py is
  this extension module is available
* Add vis.vtk.savefig3d to save a Mayavi scene
* Add default solvers to inversion functions so that general users don't need to
  dig into fatiando.inversion
* Rename utils.comtaminate to contam
* Make logger get the level from string instead of having to import logging
* Make unit tests to test Cython prism and numpy prism

PRIORITY:

* Transform all geometric elements into classes

TODO:

* In PrismMesh.dump: take a mesh file and a dict of prop:propfile pairs instead
  of creating files. This is better to mock with StringIO.
* consider making the parameter vector a dictionary
    * one array for each prop
    * this way the datamodules only operate on their props
* Sparse Jacobian computation in SrTomo still too slow (much slower than dense
  version)
* Consider getting rid of use_sparse functions and DampingSparse type regularizers.
  Instead, use sparse=True keyword arguments
* Fix recipe epicenter_regularized.py


BUGS:

* BUG in talwani.c: wrong result when zv==zvp1 (and a little wrong when xv==0)
