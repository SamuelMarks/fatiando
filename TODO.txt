GOALS FOR 1.0:

* Make Developement Guide
* Reconsider the API. Make explicit apis for each method (potential, etc) that
  imports all you might need (with shorter names). Maybe something like:
     from fatiando.apis import pot
  which loads all potential modules, gridder, logger, etc


GOALS FOR 0.1:

* Migrate C extensions from f2py to Cython
* Incorporate Tesseroids: gravitational modeling in spherical coordinates



PRIORITY:

* Make the setup script put the version hash in a file. Then version.py will
  load the hash from file and put a "UNKNOWN" if it can't read (so that Read The
  Docs builds don't fail)

TODO:

* consider making the parameter vector a dictionary
    * one array for each prop
    * this way the datamodules only operate on their props
* Sparse Jacobian computation in SrTomo still too slow (much slower than dense
  version)
* Consider getting rid of use_sparse functions and DampingSparse type regularizers.
  Instead, use sparse=True keyword arguments
* Fix recipe epicenter_regularized.py


BUGS:

* BUG in talwani.c: wrong result when zv==zvp1 (and a little wrong when xv==0)
