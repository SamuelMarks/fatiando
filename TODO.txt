General
    * Write better (or any at all) docs for the inverse problem theory
    * Make example wikis
    * Make tutorial for subclassing LinearSolver    


LinearSolver
    * Implement equality constraints (Working in Tikhonov but not tested in TV)
    * Compactness regularization
    * Sparsity regularization
    * Fix data weighting in the Tikhonov regularization
    * Take away the summing identity fix in TV and replace it with Tikhonov 1
    
    Done:
    * Depth weights
    
    
PGrav
    * Separate derivatives in each direction
    * Build sensibility concurrently
    
    Done:
    * Automate configuration of the 3D plot
    

SimpleTom
    * make integration test output pngs instead of using pylab.show()
    
WaveFD
    * Make WaveFD1D output Seismogram instances


Geometry
    * Discretize a sphere into prisms
    
    
Dicrect Models
    * Create wikis
    

Grav
    * potential and derivatives of a sphere
    * C functions receive prism struct
    * Tesseroids
