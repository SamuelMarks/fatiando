    - gridder
    - vis
    - utils
    - stats
    - seismic
    - eqlayer
    - prism
    - sphere
    - synthetic (get rid of)
    - transforms

* MORE UNIT TESTS!!!
* Change from f2py to ctypes
* Include mercurial changeset when making a distribution so that install has this information
* Make a fat script that interfaces with all fatiando.modules (like hg or pip)
* Move the test script to fatiando.modules and run it with "fat test" command
* Move all unit tests to fatiando.tests package
* Make automatic test discovery and run
* Build extention shared libs using SCons
* Two types of grid loading: load and stream
* make grids as iterators
* make get_column methods in grids that are not streams
* make export to VTK method in mesh that is independent of tvtk module
* Convert string VTK file to tvtk structure for plotting with vis mod
* Make a fatiando.modules package that automatically loads all modules as subcommands
* Change fatiando package to "package" and use specific name in the setup.py
* Try to make only numpy a requirement (optional mpl and mayavi if doing scripting)
* Write README
* Write docs for the inverse problem theory
* Make the examples into the cookbook
* Make tutorial for implementing new inversion
* Make integration tests out of the examples
* Automatic reference generation form fatiando scripts
* Contaminate generates a grid withh errors. Sum the error using grid.sum function
* Make grid.sum function that sums specified field in 2 grids
* Make a tool to remove trailing spaces from files
* Implement sparsity regularization
* Use the data covariance matrix
* Fix 'grid', 'nx', and 'ny' in grid.cut
* Make grid.random function to generate non-regular grids
* Standardize data structures and I/O format
* vis.bbox function to plot a bounding box in mayavi
* Implement the Chi squared test for a population
* Implement the test for outliers in a population
* Implement VBA model for oceanic lithosphere
* Implement McKenzie model
* Implement gravity tensor invariants
* Implement grav of sphere
* Make vis mayavi function for sphere
* Make vis mayavi function for tesseroid
* Implement grav spherical harmonics
* Implement grav reductions
* Implement grav terrain correction
* Put all constants used into a constants.py module and pass them to the C functions
* Normalize inversion terms in solvers so that reg params are equivalent to decimal percentages
* Make all synthetic functions receive a grid object    
* Integrate Radial3D inversion with fatiando
