* inversion.gradient:
    * functions just curry the arguments and return a generic solver which only
      takes dms and regs.
    * generic solvers are generators
* specific inverse problem functions of two kinds
    * solve: takes the generic solver and runs all iterations. returns last yield
    * iterate: takes generic solver and yields each iteration
