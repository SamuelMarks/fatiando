REFACTORING:

    * Separate all visualization!
    * Separate synthetic data generation from GeoData classes
    * Make geometry a python module


General
    * Write better (or any at all) docs for the inverse problem theory
    * Make example wikis
    * Make tutorial for subclassing LinearSolver
    * Pickle *Solvers so that I can dump and reload them
    * Implement Erf and Erfc in special.c
    * Module doc in geometry
    * Module doc in special


LinearSolver (Deprecated: exchanged for GradientSolver)
    * Implement equality constraints (Working in Tikhonov but not tested in TV)
    * Compactness regularization
    * Sparsity regularization
    * Fix data weighting in the Tikhonov regularization
    * Take away the summing identity fix in TV and replace it with Tikhonov 1
    * Make first derivatives local
    
    Done:
    * Depth weights
    
    
InterG
    * Save model, load it and split it to use in adaptative discretization
    * Make integration test for this
    
    
PGrav
    * Separate derivatives in each direction
    * Build sensibility concurrently
    * Clean up the code (remove multimodal method: didn't work)
    * Check if implementing cross-derivatives is better
    
    Done:
    * Automate configuration of the 3D plot
    

SimpleTom
    * make integration test output pngs instead of using pylab.show()
    * missing cross-derivative causes tendency
    * add TV to integration tests
    
WaveFD
    * Make WaveFD1D output Seismogram instances


Geometry
    * Discretize a sphere into prisms
    
    
Dicrect Models
    * Create wikis
    

Grav
    * potential and derivatives of a sphere
    * C functions receive prism struct
    * Tesseroids
    * Change TensorComponent to GravTensor, GravVector, GravPotential
