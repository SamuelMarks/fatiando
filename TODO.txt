* Packages to fix:
    - vis
    - seismic
    - eqlayer
    - sphere
* Store neighbors so that don't re-calculate every time
* Try choosing goal value in the midle (not min or max)
* Speedup shape-of-anomaly
* Find a way to not include neighbors of seeds and still have the compactness criterion
* Check is neighbors arent None (masked)
* HARVESTER: Investigate what happens if there is a tie for lowest goal function
* Optimize harvester.sow so that it doesn't look through the whole mesh for the seed
* Deduce analytical upward continuation for tensor (blakely 168)
* Replace all module loggers with logger.dummy
* Make a fat script that interfaces with all fatiando.modules (like hg or pip)
* Two types of grid loading: load and stream
* make export to VTK method in mesh that is independent of tvtk module
* Convert string VTK file to tvtk structure for plotting with vis mod
* Make a fatiando.modules package that automatically loads all modules as subcommands
* Try to make only numpy a requirement (optional mpl and mayavi if doing scripting)
* Write README
* Write docs for the inverse problem theory
* Make the examples into the cookbook
* Make tutorial for implementing new inversion
* Automatic reference generation form fatiando scripts
* Implement sparsity regularization
* Use the data covariance matrix
* Implement the Chi squared test for a population
* Implement the test for outliers in a population
* Implement VBA model for oceanic lithosphere
* Implement McKenzie model
* Implement gravity tensor invariants
* Implement grav of sphere
* Implement Parker
* Implement spherical harmonis
* Make vis mayavi function for sphere
* Make vis mayavi function for tesseroid
* Implement grav spherical harmonics
* Implement grav reductions
* Implement grav terrain correction
* Put all constants used into a constants.py module and pass them to the C functions
* Normalize inversion terms in solvers so that reg params are equivalent to decimal percentages
* Make all synthetic functions receive a grid object
* Integrate Radial3D inversion with fatiando
