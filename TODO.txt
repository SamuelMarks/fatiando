GOALS FOR 1.0:

* Make Developement Guide


GOALS FOR 0.1:

* Migrate C extensions from f2py to Cython
* Incorporate Tesseroids: gravitational modeling in spherical coordinates
* Hand-made docs of modules that rely on C extensions to avoid having to build
  the program everytime the docs are built
* The API is now fully accessible by only import fatiando. Modules and packages
  have short nicknames for easier access (e.g., pot for potential)
  Or a single fatlab for everything.
* Start reducing the names of modules and function. Done:
    * potential.transform -> potential.trans
* Unify all the potential.*.rst etc files in doc/api into a single potential.rst
  (like wise for other packages)
* Move map and vtk back into a single module or leave them separate and import
  everything in vis/__init__.py (have to be careful of name clashes)

PRIORITY:


TODO:

* consider making the parameter vector a dictionary
    * one array for each prop
    * this way the datamodules only operate on their props
* Sparse Jacobian computation in SrTomo still too slow (much slower than dense
  version)
* Consider getting rid of use_sparse functions and DampingSparse type regularizers.
  Instead, use sparse=True keyword arguments
* Fix recipe epicenter_regularized.py


BUGS:

* BUG in talwani.c: wrong result when zv==zvp1 (and a little wrong when xv==0)


DONE:


* Change license texts to BSD
* Make the setup script put the version hash in a file. Then version.py will
  load the hash from file and put a "UNKNOWN" if it can't read (so that Read The
  Docs builds don't fail)
