Fatiando a Terra
================

Fatiando a Terra provides command-line tools and an API for a variety of
geophysical modeling applications. It makes heavy use of Numpy for linear
algebra operations, provides a high level interface to visualise your data and
results using Matplotlib for 2D and Mayavi2 for 3D. Optimized code is written in
Fortran and C and wrapped to Python using Numpy's f2py.
