Welcome!
========

*Fatiando a Terra* is a software package containing various kinds of geophysical
modeling utilities for both direct and inverse problems.
It serves as a sandbox for rapidly prototyping of modeling ideas and algorithms.
We hope that one day it will serve as a teaching tool for modeling and inverse
problems in geophysics.
Fatiando is being developed by a group of geophysics graduates from the
Universidade de São Paulo and the Observatório Nacional in Brazil.
